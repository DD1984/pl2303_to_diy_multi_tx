Program for control [DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module](https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module) from PC 
Tested with Hisky protocol [receiver](https://github.com/DD1984/nrf24l01-rc), subproto HK310 and pl2303 cable for PC connection, but program can be modified for using other protocol.

Program can bind receiver and transmit data to it.
